These are a set of web authoring and debbuging tools built into google chrome.The developmen ools provide web developers deep access into the internals of the browsers and their web applications.

The development tools are used to track down layout issues,set javaScript breakpoints,get insights for code opimization,iterate,debug and profile your website.  

1)ITERATE
 a)inspect and edit pages and styles.
  Inspect and edit on the fly any element in the DOM tree in the Elements panel.
  View and change the CSS rules applied to any selected element in the Styles pane.
  View and edit a selected element's box model in the Computed pane.
  View any changes made to your page locally in the Sources panel.

 b)Manage your local data resources.
  Inspect and manage your application’s local data resources using the Chrome Developer Tools Resources panel.
  The Resources panel lets you access data sources like IndexedDB and Web SQL databases, cookies, the Application Cache, and local and session storage, as well as page resources like images, fonts, style sheets, and the actual pages

 c)Simulate mobile devices with device mode.
  You use Chrome DevTools' Device Mode to build mobile-first, fully responsive web sites. Learn how to use it to simulate a wide range of devices and their capabilities.


2)DEBUG.
 a)Remote debugging
  DevTools enables you to try your site on various plaforms,spanning a number of device form factors. 
  Snippets are small scripts that you can author and execute within the Sources panel of Chrome DevTools. You can access and run them from any page. When you run a snippet, it executes from the context of the currently open page.
  If you have small utilities or debugging scripts which you find yourself using repeatedly on multiple pages, consider saving the scripts as Snippets. 

 b)Debug obfuscated code.
  Use server-side or build processes to automatically compress your code, then use Source Maps or DevTools' prettifier to debug it effectively. 
  
 c)Debug with breakpoints
  Chrome DevTools includes powerful breakpoint features that help you find and fix logic errors in your JavaScript code. Use different breakpoint types to control exactly what conditions can trigger a pause in script execution.

 d)Understanding security issues
  HTTPS provides critical security and data integrity both for your websites and for the people that entrust your websites with their personal information. Use the Security Panel in Chrome DevTools to debug security issues and ensure that you have properly implemented HTTPS on your websites.
  Use the Security Overview to instantly find out whether the current page is secure or non-secure.

 e)Using the console
  The Chrome DevTools Console panel is your focal point for direct interaction with a page in real time.
  The Console lets you use standard JavaScript statements and Console-specific commands while a page is live in the browser to help you debug the page. View diagnostic messages, display both raw and structured data, control and filter output, examine and modify page elements, measure execution time, and more.

 f)Interact from command line.
  The console is a full-fledged terminal you can use to interact with your page during development.
  Using the console’s commands, you can select DOM elements, profile the CPU, monitor events, and more.

 g)Watch variables in sources
  Chrome DevTools allows you to easily see multiple variables throughout your application. Watching variables within Sources keeps you out of the console and focused on improving your code.
  The Sources panel provides the ability to watch variables within your application. This is located in the watch section of the debugger sidebar. By taking advantage of this functionality you will not need repeatedly log objects to the console.

3)PROFILE
 with chrome development tools,one is able to profile and;
  -How to Look at Performance
  -Runtime Performance
  -Page Load Performance
  -Fix Memory Problems
